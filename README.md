#_Tic-Tac-Toe_

#### _An incomplete implementation of tic-tac-toe, 9/16/2015_

#### By _Julianna Green & Austin Kincaid_

## Description

_Back-end is built most of the way and the front-end is in development. The aim is to have an app that can track two player's progress through a game of tic-tac-toe._

_Issues to fix (that we're aware of):_
* Track player turns (this was brought up to us late and should have been included earlier, sorry!)
* Front-end is being built with HTML elements and has only just been basically prepared. Please continue this!

## Setup

_This application uses JavaScript, Jquery, Mocha JS, Chai JS, and finally bootstrap for styling._

* Enjoy!
